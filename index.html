	 	<p>I'm currently the <b>Lead Software Engineer/IT Manager</b> at an aerospace company based in the south-eastern United States. I've had the pleasure of designing and building mission critical systems, optimizing and automating core processes that have increased productivity, reduced errors, and reduced cost. My other responsibility include DevOps, VM management, and long term/day to day managerial functions.</p>
	 	<p>I have a <b>Master of Science in Data Science</b> from Indiana University. I spent my time at IU learning how to work with and analyze big and complex data. This included how to develop for cloud and distributed environments using frameworks and engines like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, amongst others. As well as hours spent directly coding machine learning algorithms in those distributed environments using python and java.</p>
		<p>I have a <b>Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems</b> from Jacksonville State University. For me, this is where my love for coding began. At JSU, I became hooked on the idea of creating something from nothing, turning an idea into something people could interact with, and the how the reach and power of computing could have a positive impact on both society and business. I spent my time their going through the rigors of a computer science curriculum, but my hard work paid off earning me honors and distinction with my degree and admittance into multiple honor societies.</p>

			The Task Time Tracking app is an iOS app that facilitates a job costing system and serves as a working task list for the user. The app enhances and optimizes the task's particular workflow from beginning to end. Starting with capturing task time, to the second, and finishing with multiple workflows depending on if the task was completed successfully. All guided by the app. The time captured on the app feeds back into a job costing system that enhances task and employee scheduling in the future. It also provides performance metrics about the user doing the task. This information feeds into a quality systems for training and evaluations processes.

			The Task Assignment app is an iOS app that facilitates the supervisor in assigning a task to their employees. It is an intuitive interface that is paired with a bluetooth handheld barcode scanner that allows the supervisor to assign tasks in a quick down-the-list type style. With each task assignment the app factors in work time requirements for each task, allowing the supervisor to see in real time the work load assigned to each employee. The mobile nature of the device allows the supervisor to quickly move between work ares and openly discus the assignments with their employees. Used by working supervisors, the app has optimized their assignment responsibilities freeing up their time to focus on their job functions.

			<img class="ui large right floated bordered rounded image" data-src="images/Rotable.PNG">
			The Rotable Exchange Inventory Management System is an elegant solution to a complex inventory process of exchanging items in and out of warehouse to expedite the product to the customer. I re-engineered this process based on a legacy ERP system that had average processing time of 25 minutes per item, with an average of 90 clicks across 6 different screens. My solution reduced the processing time to an average of 6-minute processing time, with an average of 12 clicks across two screens. This system also included much needed features that were not available in the legacy ERP, such as a batch processing, alerts, quality required hard stops, automated warehouse and shipping document creation, and robust warehouse activity reporting tools. This system was recently approved for a $1+ million investment and is quickly becoming a core work flow for the company.

			The Corrective Action System is a full featured software solution use to capture and record systemic problems, then give a platform for solving that problem via a specific workflow. The platform includes the ability to subdivide the corrective action into 1 or more components, called findings. Each finding can be managed independently via user and due date assignments, automated alerts, and workflow control. This solution meet various stringent internal, regulatory, and standards organization requirements.

			<h4 class="ui header purple">Yamazumi Board: Work Assignment Tool</h4>
			The Yamazumi board is an interactive work assignment tool. It visually shows what work is currently not assigned (left two columns) and the work currently assigned to each team member. The work assignment is done by bragging and dropping a work square from on column to another. As a work square is assigned to a team member, their available work time (seen in blue below the team member name) decreases based on the work blocks time to complete. Subsequently, if a work block is pulled away from a team member, their available work time increases. This tool gives the team lead visual way to understand the current work demands on each employee, while at the same time allowing a team member to understand their specific demands. This tool was designed to be displayed on a large screen in the work area to allow a for a high level of transparency about what each team member is assigned, and how much work each team member is assigned.

			About Me
		</h4>
		<p>Outside of work, my life revolves around my family, cycling, coffee; with a bit of traveling and backpacking mixed in. With two young children, they dominate most of my free time. And honestly, I would not want it any other way. Road cycling is a passion I have developed over the past few years. I try and ride as often as I can. I compete, and I use "compete" liberally here, in local bikes races. And coffee, every programmers life juice. I'll take it anyway I can get it. My wonderful wife introduced me into how much fun traveling can be, but one of the best parts (and one of our favorite things to do when traveling) is finding the local coffee houses and sampling the goods.</p>
